# Invisibility Cloak with Python and OpenCV
 
This project is a fun experiment inspired by the Harry Potter invisibility cloak, built using Python and OpenCV. The idea is to detect a specific colored cloth (like red or green), capture the background in real-time, and replace the cloth with that background â€” creating the magical effect of invisibility.
 
Project Overview
 
Using computer vision, this project detects a specified color from a cloth, captures the background, and replaces the color with the background, making the cloth "disappear." It utilizes the power of image masking, real-time video processing, and HSV color space to make this effect work.
 
Features
 
Real-time video processing using OpenCV
 
Custom color detection for the cloth (e.g., red, green)
 
Live HSV tuning tool to adjust for tricky patterns
 
Ability to record video with the invisibility effect in place
 
Distance-based detection experimentation for improved accuracy
 
 
Getting Started
 
Prerequisites
 
To run this project on your local machine, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You'll also need to install OpenCV and other necessary libraries.
 
 
Features & Customization
 
HSV Tuning: The script includes an interactive tool for adjusting the HSV values to suit different cloth patterns.
